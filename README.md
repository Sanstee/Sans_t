# Sans_t
A GCC plugin prototype for detecting a type mismatch bug.

One should use GCC version 9.2.0 to build Sans_t.
It is required to run `./contrib/download_prerequisites` from the top-level GCC source directory before building GCC, in order to build Sans_t.  
To build Sans_t, simply run:  
`make`

Then use the shared object, which is placed in the directory `plugin/`, as follows:  
`gcc -fplugin=[PLUGIN_PATH]/sans_t_scoped.so -c [C_FILE(S)] -Wall`  
`-Wall` allows the plugin to emit warnings (this can be changed to another flag in the source code (`opt_code trigger_flag = OPT_Wall`)).

Or alternatively use the following for projects with a makefile:  
`export CFLAGS='[PLUGIN_PATH]/sans_t_scoped.so -Wall'`  

The directory `plugin/` contains a pre-build version of the plugin prototype.  
The directory `_outfiles/` contains some example warnings that are generated by Sans_t.
